Project is related to user interface simple Web App build in Flask for engineering thesis purposes: https://github.com/PsimonL/Navigator-EnginneringThesis-SupportApp/
It was build to demonstrate visualization methods for the applied techniques and it's not fully tested and functioning application.

Project is related to: https://github.com/Pyother/AreaExplorer
**Pyother** and I work together on similar ideas. He manages embedded/electronics side and data gathering. 
**I cope with optimization, AI and software related to motion planning**.
